## Requirements

- [**Kirby**](https://getkirby.com/) 2.3+

## Installation

### [Kirby CLI](https://github.com/getkirby/cli)

```
kirby plugin:install bnomei/kirby-siteoption
```

### Git Submodule

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/bnomei/kirby-siteoption.git site/plugins/kirby-siteoption
```

### Copy and Paste

1. [Download](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby-siteoption/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository as ZIP-file.
2. Rename the extracted folder to `kirby-siteoption` and copy it into the `site/plugins/` directory in your Kirby project.

## Usage

Let's assume you have `site/blueprint/site.yml` with a field named `contactadress`.

```
  contactadress:
    label: Contact Adress
    type:  textarea
```

When editing your pages in the Panel you want to get that value inside a textfield. This plugin makes that easy.

```
(siteoption: contactadress)
```

Or you can get the value of the field parsed with `kirbytext()`.

```
(siteoption: contactadress output: kirbytext)
```
